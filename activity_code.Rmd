# This is my code for the activity assignment
Dexter Nguyen

## Loading the data

This is the data I used for this assignment

```{r data}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)
data = read.csv("activity.csv")
data <- as.data.table(data)
```

## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum)
```

2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day. 

```{r}
Total_steps <- data.frame(tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum))
Total_steps$steps = Total_steps$tapply.data.steps..data.date..sum.
ggplot(Total_steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
        labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
Mean_steps = mean(Total_steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
Mean_steps
Median_steps = median(Total_steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
Median_steps
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
data$interval <- as.factor(data$interval)
Interval_steps <- data.frame(tapply(data$steps, data$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
Interval_steps <- cbind(rownames(Interval_steps), Interval_steps)
rownames(Interval_steps) <- NULL
colnames(Interval_steps) <- c("interval","avg_steps")
ggplot(Interval_steps, aes(x = interval , y = avg_steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
which.max(Interval_steps$avg_steps)
Interval_steps[104,]
```

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r}
nrow(data[is.na(data$steps),])
``` 

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
data <- as.data.table(data)
data[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- data[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
data.table::fwrite(x = data, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

```{r}
Total_Steps <- data[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_steps = mean(steps), Median_steps = median(steps))]
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
        day <- weekdays(date)
        if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")) 
                return("weekday") else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) 
                        return("weekend") else stop("invalid date")
}
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
data$day <- sapply(data$date, FUN = weekday.or.weekend)
str(data)
```
  
2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data = data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) + 
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```
